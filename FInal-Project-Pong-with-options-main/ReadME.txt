Hello!

This is my final project. In which I have introduced new options for giving the user a liberty to choose either to play among humans or play it against the comupter/AI.

For option one, the user gets a chance to choose between to choose human versus human or computer versus human or computer versus computer. 

For the second option, the user gets a chance to choose the level of difficulty from easy, medium, and hard. 

For the third option, The user gets a chance to choose either left or right. 

In the last option, the user gets a chance to choose which keys to use between W-S keys or up and down arrow keys. 

In order to quit the game, the user can press the escape button is press escape to return to the main menu. Thanks to Aditya Kahnna for explaining the new coding parts introduced.

THANK YOU FOR CHECKING OUT MY PROJECT.
